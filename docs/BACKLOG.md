# MathFirst Backlog Registry

This document serves as the authoritative registry for **accepted inactive work** on MathFirst.

---

## 1. Backlog Governance Rules

1. **Authoritative Registry**: All accepted deferred packages, features, and non-immediate improvements must be recorded in this registry.
2. **Stable Package Identifiers**: Every backlog item is assigned a permanent, unique identifier in the canonical format `MF-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER>` (e.g. `MF-GOV-001`, `MF-CALC-001`, `MF-UX-001`, `MF-PERSIST-001`).
   - Category prefixes are short, stable, and domain-meaningful.
   - The numeric portion is zero-padded (e.g. `001`, `002`).
3. **No Renumbering or Reuse**: Once assigned, an identifier is never renumbered, renamed, or reused for another purpose, even if the item is completed, declined, or superseded.
4. **No Speculative Items**: Do not add speculative ideas or placeholder packages without explicit product definition and approval.
5. **Inactive Work Only**: Active work in flight is tracked operationally in [docs/CURRENT_WORK.md](CURRENT_WORK.md), not here.

## 2. Item Schema Definition

When items are accepted into the backlog, they are recorded with:
- **ID**: Unique canonical `MF-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER>` identifier.
- **Title**: Descriptive title.
- **Type**: `Governance`, `Product`, `Architecture`, `Feature`, `Refactoring`, or `Documentation`.
- **Status**: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deferred`, `Superseded`, or `Completed`.
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites required before implementation.
- **Description**: Brief scope summary and acceptance criteria.

### MF-LEARN-002: Adaptive Pace, Fast Acquisition, and Practice Interventions

- **ID**: `MF-LEARN-002`
- **Title**: Adaptive Pace, Fast Acquisition, and Practice Interventions
- **Type**: `Feature`
- **Status**: `Completed` (Merged through PR #15 at `b2c5a43707167d5f6720d66834ebbbd3c6ede1d1`)
- **Dependencies**: `MF-STAB-001` complete (merged through PR #13)
- **Description**:
  Comprehensive adaptive learning model enhancement focusing on dual optimization of arithmetic correctness and retrieval speed:
  1. **Adaptive Pace & Deadlines**: Hierarchical shrinkage pace estimation ($P_0 = 4500\text{ ms}$; learner $W=12, N=30$; operation $W=8, N=20$; band $W=6, N=15$; fact $W=4, N=5$) clamped to $[600, 12000]\text{ ms}$. Exact-fact instability allowance adds $+1000\text{ ms}$ for Incorrect and $+1500\text{ ms}$ for Timeout across the last 5 attempts (clamped to $[0, 3000]\text{ ms}$). Answer deadlines are calculated as $\lceil (2 \cdot P_{\text{fact}} + \text{Allowance}) / 100 \rceil \cdot 100\text{ ms}$, clamped to $[3000, 30000]\text{ ms}$, with a cold baseline of $9000\text{ ms}$.
  2. **Adaptive Fluency & Ratings**: FSRS ratings adapt to fact pace: Easy $\le \text{clamp}(\lfloor 0.85 \cdot P_{\text{fact}} \rceil, 600, 2000)\text{ ms}$, Good $\le \text{clamp}(\lfloor 1.25 \cdot P_{\text{fact}} \rceil, 1500, 4000)\text{ ms}$, Hard $> \text{FluencyThreshold}$, and Again on error or timeout. Persisted `is_fluent` in Schema V6.
  3. **Fast Acquisition**: Dense bands with owned frontier size $N \in [1, 12]$ advance immediately when all $N$ facts achieve 100% Correct and raw response latency $\le 2000\text{ ms}$ on their first positioned encounter after band start, with a clean qualifying prefix within the phase-aware $N$-th requested-New role horizon. (Note: Fast Acquisition was subsequently retired by MF-LEARN-003 / ADR-0005).
  4. **Selector Model**: Role-specific selector chains (`Requested New`, `Requested Due`, `Requested Maintenance`, `Requested Frontier`) eliminate `AnyMaterialized`. `Early Review` ($\text{DuePracticePosition} > \text{prospectivePosition}$, not in remediation) acts as a strictly bounded liveness bridge. Cooldown relaxation occurs strictly within the selected semantic pool. Remediation priority override triggers when `NeedsRemediation == true` and $\text{prospectivePosition} \ge \text{LastReviewPracticePosition} + 4$.
  5. **Teaching Interventions**: Non-mutating canonical equation teaching overlay triggers on a second consecutive session error on the same exact `FactId`, requiring deliberate acknowledgement without generating attempt records, advancing Practice Position, or mutating FSRS card state.
  6. **Session Check-ins**: Periodic checkpoint occurs every 20 accepted attempts, presenting correct count and median latency of correct attempts only, offering "Keep Going" and "Take a Break" choices with guaranteed zero-timing pause semantics.
  7. **Clean Practice HUD**: Distraction-free practice screen with transient session score and progress indicators removed; danger-styled Pause button in red.

### MF-REL-001: Android Internal AAB Packaging and Release Automation

- **ID**: `MF-REL-001`
- **Title**: Android Internal AAB Packaging and Release Automation
- **Type**: `Feature`
- **Status**: `Deferred`
- **Dependencies**: `MF-LEARN-003` complete and merged to `main`
- **Description**:
  Establish repeatable Android App Bundle (AAB) packaging, release build automation, keystore management protocols, and local packaging validation scripts for internal distribution and eventual Google Play testing. Packaging and signing remain isolated from publishing; actual store uploads require separate explicit authorization. This package remains deferred and not started until `MF-LEARN-003` completes its entire lifecycle.
