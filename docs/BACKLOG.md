# MathFirst Backlog Registry

This document serves as the authoritative registry for **accepted inactive work** on MathFirst.

---

## 1. Backlog Governance Rules

1. **Authoritative Registry**: All accepted deferred packages, features, and non-immediate improvements must be recorded in this registry.
2. **Stable Package Identifiers**: Every backlog item is assigned a permanent, unique identifier in the canonical format `MF-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER>` (e.g. `MF-GOV-001`, `MF-CALC-001`, `MF-UX-001`, `MF-PERSIST-001`).
   - Category prefixes are short, stable, and domain-meaningful.
   - The numeric portion is zero-padded (e.g. `001`, `002`).
3. **No Renumbering or Reuse**: Once assigned, an identifier is never renumbered, renamed, or reused for another purpose, even if the item is completed, declined, or superseded.
4. **No Speculative Items**: Do not add speculative ideas or placeholder packages without explicit product definition and approval.
5. **Inactive Work Only**: Active work in flight is tracked operationally in [docs/CURRENT_WORK.md](CURRENT_WORK.md), not here.

## 2. Item Schema Definition

When items are accepted into the backlog, they are recorded with:
- **ID**: Unique canonical `MF-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER>` identifier.
- **Title**: Descriptive title.
- **Type**: `Governance`, `Product`, `Architecture`, `Feature`, `Refactoring`, or `Documentation`.
- **Status**: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deferred`, `Superseded`, or `Completed`.
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites required before implementation.
- **Description**: Brief scope summary and acceptance criteria.
